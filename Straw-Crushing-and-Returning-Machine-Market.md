Let’s take a closer look at the trends and expectations driving this shift.</p> <h2>2018-2022: Market Overview</h2> <p>From 2018 to 2022, the demand for stretch mark removal machines was primarily fueled by the increasing awareness of cosmetic treatments and the growing popularity of non-invasive skin care options.
